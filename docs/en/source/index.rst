SciEvalKit Documentation
========================

**SciEvalKit** is an open‑source evaluation framework and leaderboard aimed at measuring the **scientific intelligence** of large language and vision–language models.
Although modern frontier models often achieve *~90* on general‑purpose benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on rigorous, domain‑specific scientific tasks—revealing a persistent **general‑versus‑scientific gap** that motivates the need for SciEval.

For detailed information on each benchmark supported by the SciEvalKit, please refer to `SciEvalKit Feature Status <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cuqNEoVAMURKGQV5V8CkGT6MjsUhdxVsYpCIUS8t3qw/edit#gid=0>`_.
*Sheet Requests* is dedicated to collecting new or collaborative evaluation benchmarks proposed by community scholars.
